# Music-Recommendation-System
Final Year Project By Team 33. Team Members are Nitin Suraj, Sejal Ksheer Sagar and Shivani M V

In this project we have three files:
1. Twitter Scrapping
2. Sentiment analysis using Lexicon Based Approach
3. Recommendation System

Twitter Scrapping: It is carried out using the selenium web driver and the latest tweet that is scrapped is stored in the "sentiment.txt" file.
Sentiment analysis using Lexicon Based Approach: We have a pre-defined dataset where there are different words or lexicons stored in "lexicon_easy.csv" where every lexicon is associated with a score that will imply if the emotion is positive, negative or nuetral.
Recommendation System: With the score that is calculated from the lexicon based approach we recommend music from the existing dataset values that are prsent in "songs.txt"
